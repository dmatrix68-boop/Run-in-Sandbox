## 2026-10-09
### Fixed
- Fixed `Remove_Structure.ps1` not removing the `.img` context menu added in 2026-08-07
- Fixed installation aborting when `HKCU\Software\Classes\.msix` exists without an `OpenWithProgids` subkey, and MSIX entries being written to a wrong key when more than one ProgID is registered
- Fixed "Extract ISO file in Sandbox" pointing the sandbox to the host path of the cached 7-Zip installer (only used when 7-Zip is not installed on the host)
- Fixed the "Failed to download 7-Zip installer" message never being shown when the download failed and no cached installer existed
- Fixed the sandbox not starting at all when no classic `notepad.exe.mui` can be found (the Notepad payload is optional now)
- Fixed application bundles (`.sdbapp`) not finding their files: folders are now mapped to `C:\SBDApp\<folder name>` as expected by `AppBundle_Install.ps1`; `.ps1`/`.vbs` paths with spaces and a missing `Silent_Switch` element are handled
- Fixed files in folders with `[` or `]` in their name being started from a wrong path in the sandbox
- Fixed the installer always using `master` for updates instead of the installed branch when `-Branch` is not given
- Fixed deep-clean updates deleting custom startup scripts and the just created backup folder
- Fixed update creating nested empty folders (e.g. `Modules\Shared\Shared`)
- Fixed deep-clean possibly scanning the wrong user's `HKCU_Classes` hive
- Fixed the Windows Sandbox feature check never reaching its fallback when `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature` fails, and the disk space check assuming drive `C:`
- Fixed `RunInSandbox_Config.ps1` (`Add_Structure.ps1 -NoSilent`) failing to load its assemblies and XAML when started from another folder
- Fixed `Remove_Structure.ps1` reporting success although the installation folder could not be removed
- Fixed the registry backup (`Registry_Backup` folder) never being created: `Export-RegConfig` returned before exporting anything. Each modified key is now exported once, before the first change, keys containing `\` no longer point into a folder that does not exist, HKCR and HKU backups of the same key no longer overwrite each other, and an existing backup is kept on updates
- Fixed the HTML/URL entry: the path was passed with its double quotes inside single quotes (`-LiteralPath '"C:\..."'`), so `Invoke-Item` never found the file
- Fixed the HTML entry showing twice for Edge/Chrome users: it is only added to `SystemFileAssociations` now (which applies to every default browser), and `.htm` and `.url` are covered as well. The browser ProgID entries of older versions are still removed on uninstall
- Fixed the ZIP entry missing when another application (7-Zip, PeaZip, WinZip, ...) is the default for .zip files: it is also added to the ProgID of that application
- Fixed "Run EXE with switches" breaking on file names with spaces (`EXE_Install.ps1`)
- Fixed `IntuneWin_Install.ps1` failing when the dialog wrote a trailing new line
- Fixed application bundles (`.sdbapp`) with another file name than `App_Bundle.sdbapp` not being found by `AppBundle_Install.ps1`
- Fixed the launch failing for standard users when `_orchestrator.ps1` (installed by the elevated installer) could not be overwritten: it is only written when missing or outdated now, and the existing one is used if that fails. A failing write of `OriginalCommand.txt` reports the path instead of starting a sandbox that does nothing
- Notepad payload: a missing `notepad.exe.mui` no longer skips the whole payload (only the localized strings are missing then), the 0 byte app execution alias in WindowsApps is not copied any more, and `01-Copy-Notepad.ps1` no longer registers "Edit with Notepad" when no notepad.exe was staged
- Fixed downloads of branches containing `/` (the extracted folder is read from the archive now)

### Added
- The sandbox uses **Notepad++** from the host when it is installed: its folder is mounted read only to `C:\Program Files\Notepad++` (like the host installation of 7-Zip), and inside the sandbox "Edit with Notepad++", "Open Notepad++" on the folder background and the .txt association are registered. Only without Notepad++ the classic Notepad is staged
- `RunInSandbox.ps1` writes its log to `%TEMP%\RunInSandbox.log` and shows a message box on errors, unknown `-Type` values and a missing .wsb file, instead of failing silently because it is started with `-WindowStyle Hidden`
- Added `-RepoOwner` and `-RepoName` parameters to `Install_Run-in-Sandbox.ps1` to install from a fork. The repository is stored in `version.json`, so updates stay on it; default is still `Joly0/Run-in-Sandbox`


## 2026-08-07
### Added
- Added .img file to "Run X in Sandbox"-options


## 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- Fixed `Add_Structure.ps1` not adding the ps1 context menu when the UserChoice ProgID has no `Shell` subkey in HKCR (e.g. after removing PowerShell ISE the gate `Test-Path "$HKCR_UserChoice_Key\Shell"` returned `$False` and the menu was silently skipped). The cascade is now written to `HKCU\Software\Classes\<ProgID>\Shell` so the menu shows up via the merged HKCR view even without a machine-wide entry, and the whole block is wrapped in try/catch with a null guard on the UserChoice ProgID. Fixes [#20]https://github.com/Joly0/Run-in-Sandbox/issues/20
- Mirrored the above ps1 UserChoice fix in `Remove_Structure.ps1` so the uninstall removes the entries from both the new `HKCU_Classes\<ProgID>\Shell` location and the legacy HKCR one for older installs
- Fixed Intunewin context menu failing with `Cannot dot-source this command because it was defined in a different language mode` when AppLocker enforces ConstrainedLanguage on scripts under `C:\ProgramData\Run_in_Sandbox\`. The registry verb command now invokes `RunInSandbox.ps1` via `-Command "& '...'"` instead of `-File`, which internally dot-sources and triggers the language mode mismatch
- Fixed Intunewin install dialog silently auto-closing on some locked-down Windows 11 builds (focus-stealing prevention / ASR rules can tear down the WPF/MahApps window before the `+` click handler runs). Added a `Windows.Forms` InputBox fallback that takes over when the WPF dialog produces no install command
- Fixed `IntuneWin_Install.ps1` silently exiting inside the sandbox when no install command was captured. Replaced the silent `EXIT` with visible MessageBoxes so the reason is shown on the sandbox desktop


## 2026-04-30a
### Fixed
- Fixed regression bug with previous bug fix, should finally solve [#18]https://github.com/Joly0/Run-in-Sandbox/issues/18

## 2026-04-30
### Fixed

## 2026-03-30
### Fixed
- Fixed logging file path being affected by Windows 8.3 short paths when username has space should fix [#17]https://github.com/Joly0/Run-in-Sandbox/issues/17


## 2026-03-04
### Fixed
- Fixed `_orchestrator.ps1` access denied error when starting a sandbox after a fresh install
- Fixed cleanup of Intunewin and EXE temp files not being removed when sandbox is closed
- Fixed installation not stopping on errors (replaced `EXIT` with `throw` in validation functions for proper error propagation)
### Changed
- Moved runtime temp files (`Intunewin_Folder.txt`, `Intunewin_Install_Command.txt`, `EXE_Command_File.txt`) into the `temp/` subfolder
- Installer now sets targeted `Modify` permissions for BUILTIN\Users on `temp/`, `startup-scripts/`, and `Sandbox_Config.xml` instead of `FullControl` on the entire install folder
### Added
- `Set-UserWritePermissions` function in `Environment.psm1` for reusable, language-independent permission management
- Pre-install prerequisite checks for RAM (≥4 GB) and disk space (≥1 GB free)
- Option to automatically enable Windows Sandbox feature if not installed, with user confirmation and manual reboot
- `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` in `Add_Structure.ps1` to halt on any error
